DW


The DW module works but can be significantly improved if someone wants
to do it.  Currently, it 'stat(2)'s all files that it finds in the
directory tree that it is watching regarless of the state of the file.
A better approach would be to only 'stat(2)' those files that it finds
that are not already recorded as either subdirectories or as file
entries !  This would save tons of wasted 'stat(2)'s and would keep the
OS i-node cache free of extra files that really did not have to be
'stat(2)'ed so often !

The maintenance code consists of periodically checking ('stat(2)'ing)
all file entries that are recorded to see if they still exist or not.
Entries that fail to 'stat(2)' are assumed to be removed from the
directory.  This may not be true since the file directory entry could
be a dangling symbolic link !  To reduce this excess 'stat(2)'ing,
files are only 'stat(2)'ed if their last check time (last time they
were 'stat(2)'ed) is older than some amount.

Suggestions: 

For starters, you could change out the use of a VECSTR object
for storing subdirectories to a HDBSTR object !

Next, change out the use of the VECELEM object for storing file
entries with a HDB object.



Enjoy.
