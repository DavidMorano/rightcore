Preface to the King James Version of 1611

.ce
.SM "THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED"

Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything
ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured by others,
deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold
entertainment in the world.  
It is welcomed with suspicion instead of
love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole
left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will
make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be
condemned.  
This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or
have any experience.  
For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured
any way of newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of
gainsaying, or opposition?  
A man would think that Civility, wholesome
Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we
speak of no more things of this kind) should be as safe as a Sanctuary,
and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no,
nor dog move his tongue against the motioners of them. 
For by the
first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By
the second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour,
and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by violence; By the
third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and
feeling that we have attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth
being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our
differences than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the
Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and
conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill
their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers and
mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon
their breasts (and upon whose breasts again themselves do hang to
receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and
support fit for their estates.  
Thus it is apparent, that these things
which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none,
either without absurdity can speak against them, or without note of
wickedness can spurn against them.

Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis
with others] have been brought to untimely death for none other fault,
but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline;
and that in some Commonwealths (e.g. Locri) it was made a capital
crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an
old, though the same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the
elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of
Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way
to good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselves as averse from
them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no
babe, but a great clerk [Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in
writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he
gave forth, that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or
meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against
Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and
messengers of the great King of Kings should be furnished, it is not
unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better
by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised;
Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of
Christianity in the Church of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally
endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying: Now is poison
poured down into the Church, etc\(hy.
Thus not only as oft as we speak, as
one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or consequence, we
subject ourselves to everyone's censure, and happy is he that is least
tossed upon tongues; for utterly to escape the snatch of them it is
impossible.  
If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of
the meaner sort only, and that Princes are privileged by their high
estate, he is deceived.  
"As the sword devoureth as well one as the
other," as it is in Samuel [II\ Samuel\ 11:25], nay as the great Commander
charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the
enemy, but at the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief
Captains to "fight neither with small nor great, save only against the
King of Israel:" [I\ Kings 22:31] so it is too true, that Envy striketh
most spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest.  
David was a
worthy Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds,
and yet for as worthy as act as ever he did (even for bringing back the
Ark of God in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife
[II\ Samuel\ 6:16].  
Solomon was greater than David, though not in virtue,
yet in power: and by his power and wisdom he built a Temple to the
Lord, such a one as was the glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder
of the whole world.  
But was that his magnificence liked of by all?  
We
doubt it.  
Otherwise, why do they lay it in his son's dish, and call
unto him for easing the burden, "Make," say they, "the grievous
servitude of thy father, and his sore yoke, lighter?" [I\ Kings\ 12:4]\ \0
Belike he had charged them with some levies, and troubled them with
some carriages; Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their
heart the Temple had never been built.  
So hard a thing it is to please
all, even when we please God best, and do seek to approve ourselves to
every ones conscience.

If we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples
of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance.  
The first Roman Emperor
[C. Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the
learned, nor more profitable to posterity, for conserving the record of
times in true supputation; than when he corrected the Calendar, and
ordered the year according to the course of the Sun; and yet this was
imputed to him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him great
obloguy.  
So the first Christened Emperor [Constantine] (at the
least-wise that openly professed the faith himself, and allowed others
to do the like) for strengthening the Empire at his great charges, and
providing for the Church, as he did, got for his labour the name
Pupillus, as who would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need of a
Guardian or overseer [Aurel, Victor].  
So the best Christened Emperor [Theodosius], 
for the love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich
both himself and his subjects, and because he did not see war but find
it, was judged to be no man at arms [Zosimus], (though indeed he
excelled in feats of chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked)
and condemned for giving himself to his ease, and to his pleasure.  
To
be short, the most learned Emperor of former times [Justinian], (at the
least, the greatest politician) what thanks had he for cutting off the
superfluities of the laws, and digesting them into some order and
method?  
This, that he had been blotted by some to be an Epitomist,
that is, one that extinguishes worthy whole volumes, to bring his
abridgments into request.  
This is the measure that hath been rendered
to excellent Princes in former times, even, Cum bene facerent, male
audire, For their good deeds to be evil spoken of.  
Neither is there
any likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the
ancient.  
No, no, the reproof of Moses taketh hold of most ages; "You
are risen up in your fathers' stead, 
and increase of sinful men." [Numbers\ 32:14]\ \0
"What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done;
and there is no new thing under the Sun," 
saith the wiseman: [Ecclesiastes\ 1:9]
and S.\ Stephen, "As your fathers did, so do you." [Acts\ 7:51]

.SM "HIS MAJESTY'S CONSTANCY, NOTWITHSTANDING CULMINATION,"
.SM "FOR THE SURVEY OF THE ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS"

This, and more to this purpose, His Majesty that now reigneth (and
long, and long may he reign, and his offspring forever, "Himself and
children, and children's always) knew full well, according to the
singular wisdom given unto him by God, and the rare learning and
experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever attempteth
anything for the public (especially if it pertain to Religion, and to
the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himself
upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth
himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue.  
For he
that medleth with men's Religion in any part, medleth with their
custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they find no content in
that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.
Notwithstanding his Royal heart was not daunted or discouraged for this
that colour, but stood resolute, "as a statue immovable, and an anvil
not easy to be beaten into plates," as one [Suidas] saith; he knew who
had chosen him to be a Soldier, or rather a Captain, and being assured
that the course which he intended made for the glory of God, and the
building up of his Church, he would not suffer it to be broken off for
whatsoever speeches or practices.  
It doth certainly belong unto Kings,
yea, it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea,
it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to
know it aright, yea, to profess it zealously, yea to promote it to the
uttermost of their power.  
This is their glory before all nations which
mean well, and this will bring unto them a far most excellent weight of
glory in the day of the Lord Jesus.  
For the Scripture saith not in
vain, "Them that honor me, I will honor," [I\ Samuel\ 2:30] neither was it a
vain word that Eusebius delivered long ago, that piety towards God was
the weapon and the only weapon, that both preserved Constantine's
person, and avenged him of his enemies [Eusebius lib 10 cap 8].

.ne 3
.ce
.SM "THE PRAISE OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES"

But now what piety without truth? what truth (what saving truth)
without the word of God?  
What word of God (whereof we may be sure)
without the Scripture?  
The Scriptures we are commanded to search [John\ 5:39, Isaiah\ 8:20].  
They are commended that searched and studied 
them [Acts\ 17:11, and Acts\ 8:28-29].  
They are reproved that were unskillful in
them, or slow to believe them [Matthew\ 22:29, Luke\ 24:25].  
They can make
us wise unto salvation [II\ Timothy\ 3:15].  
If we be ignorant, they will
instruct us; if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of
order, they will reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull,
quicken us; if cold, inflame us.  
Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up and
read, take up and read the Scriptures [S.\ August. confess. lib 8 cap
12], (for unto them was the direction) it was said unto S.\ Augustine by
a supernatural voice.  
"Whatsoever is in the Scriptures, believe me,"
saith the same S.\ Augustine, "is high and divine; there is verily
truth, and a doctrine most fit for the refreshing of men's minds, and
truly so tempered, that everyone may draw from thence that which is
sufficient for him, if he come to draw with a devout and pious mind, as
true Religion requireth." [S.\ August. de utilitcredendi cap. 6]\ \0
Thus S.\ Augustine. and S.\ Jerome: "Ama scripturas, et amabit te sapientia
etc\(hy" [S.\ Jerome. ad Demetriad]\ \0
Love the Scriptures, and wisdom will
love thee.  
And S.\ Cyril against Julian; "Even boys that are bred up in
the Scriptures, become most religious, 
etc\(hy" [S.\ Cyril. 7 contra Iulianum]\ \0
But what mention we three or four uses of the Scripture,
whereas whatsoever is to be believed or practiced, or hoped for, is
contained in them? or three or four sentences of the Fathers, since
whosoever is worthy the name of a Father, from Christ's time downward,
hath likewise written not only of the riches, but also of the
perfection of the Scripture?  
"I adore the fulness of the Scripture,"
saith Tertullian against Hermogenes [Tertul. advers. Hermo.].
And
again, to Apelles an heretic of the like stamp, he saith; "I do not
admit that which thou bringest in (or concludest) of thine own (head or
store, de tuo) without Scripture." [Tertul. de carne Christi.]\ \0
So
Saint Justin Martyr before him; "We must know by all means," saith he,
"that it is not lawful (or possible) to learn (anything) of God or of
right piety, save only out of the Prophets, who teach us by divine
inspiration." 
So Saint Basil after Tertullian, "It is a manifest
falling way from the Faith, and a fault of presumption, either to
reject any of those things that are written, or to bring in (upon the
head of them) any of those things that are not written.  
We omit to
cite to the same effect, S.\ Cyril\ B.\ of Jerusalem in his 4::Cataches.,
Saint Jerome against Helvidius, Saint Augustine in his 3::book against
the letters of Petilian, and in very many other places of his works.
Also we forebear to descend to later Fathers, because we will not weary
the reader.  
The Scriptures then being acknowledged to be so full and
so perfect, how can we excuse ourselves of negligence, if we do not
study them, of curiosity, if we be not content with them?  
Men talk
much of [an olive bow wrapped about with wood, whereupon did hang figs,
and bread, honey in a pot, and oil], how many sweet and goodly things
it had hanging on it; of the Philosopher's stone, that it turned copper
into gold; of Cornucopia, that it had all things necessary for food in
it, of Panaces the herb, that it was good for diseases, of Catholicon
the drug, that it is instead of all purges; of Vulcan's armor, that it
was an armor of proof against all thrusts, and all blows, etc\(hy.
Well,
that which they falsely or vainly attributed to these things for bodily
god, we may justly and with full measure ascribe unto the Scripture,
for spiritual.  
It is not only an armor, but also a whole armory of
weapons, both offensive and defensive; whereby we may save ourselves
and put the enemy to flight.  
It is not an herb, but a tree, or rather
a whole paradise of trees of life, which bring forth fruit every month,
and the fruit thereof is for meat, and the leaves for medicine.  
It is
not a pot of Manna, or a cruse of oil, which were for memory only, or
for a meal's meat or two, but as it were a shower of heavenly bread
sufficient for a whole host, be it never so great; and as it were a
whole cellar full of oil vessels; whereby all our necessities may be
provided for, and our debts discharged.  
In a word, it is a Panary of
wholesome food, against fenowed traditions; a Physician's shop (Saint
Basil called it) [S.\ Basil in Psal. primum.] of preservatives against
poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable laws, against rebellious
spirits; a treasury of most costly jewels, against beggarly rudiments;
finally a fountain of most pure water springing up unto everlasting
life.  
And what marvel? 
The original thereof being from heaven, not
from earth; the author being God, not man; the inditer, the holy
spirit, not the wit of the Apostles or Prophets; the Penmen such as
were sanctified from the womb, and endued with a principal portion of
God's spirit; the matter, verity, piety, purity, uprightness; the form,
God's word, God's testimony, God's oracles, the word of truth, the word
of salvation, etc\(hy; the effects, light of understanding, stableness of
persuasion, repentance from dead works, newness of life, holiness,
peace, joy in the holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of the study
thereof, fellowship with the Saints, participation of the heavenly
nature, fruition of an inheritance immortal, undefiled, and that never
shall fade away: Happy is the man that delighted in the Scripture, and
thrice happy that meditateth in it day and night.

.SM "TRANSLATION NECESSARY"

But how shall men meditate in that, which they cannot understand? 
How
shall they understand that which is kept close in an unknown tongue? as
it is written, "Except I know the power of the voice, I shall be to him
that speaketh, a Barbarian, and he that speaketh, shall be a Barbarian
to me." [I Cornthians 14]\ \0
The Apostle excepteth no tongue; not Hebrew the
ancientest, not Greek the most copious, not Latin the finest.  
Nature
taught a natural man to confess, that all of us in those tongues which
we do not understand, are plainly deaf; we may turn the deaf ear unto
them.  
The Scythian counted the Athenian, whom he did not understand,
barbarous [Clem. Alex. 1 Strom.]; so the Roman did the Syrian, and the
Jew (even S.\ Jerome himself called the Hebrew tongue barbarous, belike
because it was strange to so many) [S.\ Jerome. Damaso.] so the Emperor
of Constantinople [Michael, Theophili fil.] calleth the Latin tongue,
barbarous, though Pope Nicolas do storm at it: [2::Tom. Concil. ex
edit. Petri Crab] so the Jews long before Christ called all other
nations, Lognazim, which is little better than barbarous.  
Therefore as
one complaineth, that always in the Senate of Rome, there was one or
other that called for an interpreter: [Cicero 5::de finibus.] so lest
the Church be driven to the like exigent, it is necessary to have
translations in a readiness.  
Translation it is that openeth the
window, to let in the light; that breaketh the shell, that we may eat
the kernel; that putteth aside the curtain, that we may look into the
most Holy place; that removeth the cover of the well, that we may come
by the water, even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the
well, by which means the flocks of Laban were watered [Genesis\ 29:10].
Indeed without translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are
but like children at Jacob's well (which is deep) [John\ 4:11] without a
bucket or something to draw with; or as that person mentioned by
Isaiah, to whom when a sealed book was delivered, with this motion,
"Read this, I pray thee," he was fain to make this answer, "I cannot,
for it is sealed." [Isaiah\ 29:11]

.SM "THE TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT"
.SM "OUT OF THE HEBREW INTO GREEK"

While God would be known only in Jacob, and have his Name great in
Israel, and in none other place, while the dew lay on Gideon's fleece
only, and all the earth besides was dry; then for one and the same
people, which spake all of them the language of Canaan, that is,
Hebrew, one and the same original in Hebrew was 
sufficient [S.\ August. lib 12 contra Faust c32].
But, when the fulness of time drew
near, that the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God should come into
the world, whom God ordained to be a reconciliation through faith in
his blood, not of the Jew only, but also of the Greek, yea, of all them
that were scattered abroad; then lo, it pleased the Lord to stir up the
spirit of a Greek Prince (Greek for descent and language) even of
Ptolemy Philadelph King of Egypt, to procure the translating of the
Book of God out of Hebrew into Greek.  
This is the translation of the
Seventy Interpreters, commonly so called, which prepared the way for
our Saviour among the Gentiles by written preaching, as Saint John
Baptist did among the Jews by vocal.  
For the Grecians being desirous
of learning, were not wont to suffer books of worth to lie moulding in
Kings' libraries, but had many of their servants, ready scribes, to
copy them out, and so they were dispersed and made common.  
Again, the
Greek tongue was well known and made familiar to most inhabitants in
Asia, by reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made, as
also by the Colonies, which thither they had sent. 
For the same causes
also it was well understood in many places of Europe, yea, and of
Africa too.  
Therefore the word of God being set forth in Greek,
becometh hereby like a candle set upon a candlestick, which giveth
light to all that are in the house, or like a proclamation sounded
forth in the market place, which most men presently take knowledge of;
and therefore that language was fittest to contain the Scriptures, both
for the first Preachers of the Gospel to appeal unto for witness, and
for the learners also of those times to make search and trial by.  
It
is certain, that that Translation was not so sound and so perfect, but
it needed in many places correction; and who had been so sufficient for
this work as the Apostles or Apostolic men?  
Yet it seemed good to the
holy Ghost and to them, to take that which they found, (the same being
for the greatest part true and sufficient) rather than making a new, in
that new world and green age of the Church, to expose themselves to
many exceptions and cavillations, as though they made a Translations to
serve their own turn, and therefore bearing a witness to themselves,
their witness not to be regarded.  
This may be supposed to be some
cause, why the Translation of the Seventy was allowed to pass for
current.  
Notwithstanding, though it was commended generally, yet it
did not fully content the learned, no not of the Jews.  
For not long
after Christ, Aquila fell in hand with a new Translation, and after him
Theodotion, and after him Symmachus; yea, there was a fifth and a sixth
edition, the Authors whereof were not 
known [Epiphan. de mensur. et ponderibus.].  
These with the Seventy made up the Hexapla and were
worthily and to great purpose compiled together by Origen.  
Howbeit the
Edition of the Seventy went away with the credit, and therefore not
only was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth and excellency
thereof above the rest, as Epiphanius gathered) but also was used by
the Greek fathers for the ground and foundation of their Commentaries.
Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute so much unto it, that he
holdeth the Authors thereof not only for Interpreters, but also for
Prophets in some respect [S.\ August. 2::de dectrin. Christian c. 15];
and Justinian the Emperor enjoining the Jews his subjects to use
especially the Translation of the Seventy, rendreth this reason
thereof, because they were as it were enlightened with prophetical
grace.  
Yet for all that, as the Egyptians are said of the Prophet to
be men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit [Isaiah\ 31:3];
so it is evident, (and Saint Jerome affirmeth as much) [S.\ Jerome. de
optimo genere interpret] that the Seventy were Interpreters, they were
not Prophets; they did many things well, as learned men; but yet as men
they stumbled and fell, one while through oversight, another while
through ignorance, yea, sometimes they may be noted to add to the
Original, and sometimes to take from it; which made the Apostles to
leave them many times, when they left the Hebrew, and to deliver the
sense thereof according to the truth of the word, as the spirit gave
them utterance.  
This may suffice touching the Greek Translations of
the Old Testament.

.SM "TRANSLATION OUT OF HEBREW AND GREEK INTO LATIN"

There were also within a few hundred years after 
.SM CHRIST , 
translations
many into the Latin tongue: for this tongue also was very fit to convey
the Law and the Gospel by, because in those times very many Countries
of the West, yea of the South, East and North, spake or understood
Latin, being made Provinces to the Romans.  
But now the Latin
Translations were too many to be all good, for they were infinite
(Latini Interprets nullo modo numerari possunt, saith S.\ Augustine)
[S.\ Augustin. de doctr. Christ. lib 2 cap II].  
Again they were not out
of the Hebrew fountain (we speak of the Latin Translations of the Old
Testament) but out of the Greek stream, therefore the Greek being not
altogether clear, the Latin derived from it must needs be muddy. 
This
moved S.\ Jerome a most learned father, and the best linguist without
controversy, of his age, or of any that went before him, to undertake
the translating of the Old Testament, out of the very fountain with
that evidence of great learning, judgment, industry, and faithfulness,
that he had forever bound the Church unto him, in a debt of special
remembrance and thankfulness.

.SM "THE TRANSLATING OF THE SCRIPTURE INTO THE VULGAR TONGUES"

Now through the Church were thus furnished with Greek and Latin
Translations, even before the faith of 
.SM CHRIST 
was generally embraced in
the Empire; (for the learned know that even in S.\ Jerome's time, the
Consul of Rome and his wife were both Ethnics, and about the same time
the greatest part of the Senate also) [S.\ Jerome. Marcell.Zosim] yet
for all that the godly-learned were not content to have the Scriptures
in the Language which they themselves understood, Greek and Latin, (as
the good Lepers were not content to fare well themselves, but
acquainted their neighbors with the store that God had sent, that they
also might provide for themselves) [II\ Kings\ 7:9] but also for the
behoof and edifying of the unlearned which hungered and thirsted after
righteousness, and had souls to be saved as well as they, they provided
Translations into the vulgar for their Countrymen, insomuch that most
nations under heaven did shortly after their conversion, hear 
.SM CHRIST
speaking unto them in their mother tongue, not by the voice of their
Minister only, but also by the written word translated.  
If any doubt
hereof, he may be satisfied by examples enough, if enough will serve
the turn.  
First S.\ Jerome saith, Multarum gentium linguis Scriptura
ante translata, docet falsa esse quae addita sunt, etc\(hy i\(hye\(hy 
"The
Scripture being translated before in the languages of many Nations,
doth show that those things that were added (by Lucian and Hesychius)
are false." [S.\ Jerome.  praef. in 4::Evangel.]\ \0
So S.\ Jerome [saith] in that place.  
The same Jerome elsewhere affirmeth that he, the time was, had
set forth the translation of the Seventy suae linguae hominibus, i\(hye\(hy,
for his countrymen of Dalmatia [S.\ Jerome. Sophronio.].
Which words
not only Erasmus doth understand to purport, that S.\ Jerome translated
the Scripture into the Dalmatian tongue, but also Sixtus Senensis
[Six. Sen. lib 4], and Alphonsus a` Castro [Alphon. lb 1 ca 23] (that
we speak of no more), men not to be excepted against by them of Rome, do
ingenuously confess as much.  
So, S.\ Chrysostom that lived in S.\ Jerome's time, 
giveth evidence with him: "The doctrine of S.\ John
[saith he] did not in such sort [as the Philosophers' did] vanish
away: but the Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Ethiopians, and
infinite other nations being barbarous people translated it into their
[mother] tongue, and have learned to be [true] Philosophers," he
meaneth Christians [S.\ Chrysost. in Johan. cap.I. hom.I.].
To this
may be added Theodoret, as next unto him, both for antiquity, and for
learning.  
His words be these, "Every Country that is under the Sun, is
full of these words (of the Apostles and Prophets) and the Hebrew
tongue [he meaneth the Scriptures in the Hebrew tongue] is turned not
only into the Language of the Grecians, but also of the Romans, and
Egyptians, and Persians, and Indians, and Armenians, and Scythians, and
Sauromatians, and briefly into all the Languages that any Nation
useth [Theodor. 5. Therapeut.].
So he, In like manner, Ulfilas is
reported by Paulus Diaconus and Isidor (and before them by Sozomen) to
have translated the Scriptures into the Gothic tongue: [P.\ Diacon. li\(hy
12.] John Bishop of Sevil by Vasseus, to have turned them into Arabic,
about the year of our Lord 717 [Vaseus in Chron. Hispan.].
Bede by
Cistertiensis, to have turned a great part of them into Saxon: Efnard
by Trithemius, to have abridged the French Psalter, as Beded had done
the Hebrew, about the year 800: King Alfred by the said Cistertiensis,
to have turned the Psalter into 
Saxon: [Polydor. Virg. 5 histor.] Methodius 
by Aventinus (printed at Ingolstadt) to have turned the
Scriptures into Slavonian: [Aventin. lib. 4.] Valdo, Bishop of Frising
by Beatus Rhenanus, to have caused about that time, the Gospels to be
translated into Dutch rhythm, yet extant in the Library of Corbinian
[Circa annum 900. B. Rhenan. rerum German. lib 2.].
Valdus, by divers
to have turned them himself into French, about the year 1160: Charles
the Fifth of that name, surnamed the Wise, to have caused them to be
turned into French, about 200 years after Valdus his time, of which
translation there be many copies yet extant, as witnesseth Beroaldus.
Much about that time, even in our King Richard the second's days, John
Trevisa translated them into English, and many English Bibles in
written hand are yet to be seen with divers, translated as it is very
probable, in that age.  
So the Syrian translation of the New Testament
is in most learned men's Libraries, of Widminstadius his setting forth,
and the Psalter in Arabic is with many, of Augustinus Nebiensis'
setting forth.  
So Postel affirmeth, that in his travel he saw the
Gospels in the Ethiopian tongue; And Ambrose Thesius allegeth the
Pslater of the Indians, which he testifieth to have been set forth by
Potken in Syrian characters.  
So that, to have the Scriptures in the
mother tongue is not a quaint conceit lately taken up, either by the
Lord Cromwell in England, [Thuan.] or by the Lord Radevile in Polony,
or by the Lord Ungnadius in the Emperor's dominion, but hath been
thought upon, and put in practice of old, even from the first times of
the conversion of any Nation; no doubt, because it was esteemed most
profitable, to cause faith to grow in men's hearts the sooner, and to
make them to be able to say with the words of the Psalms, "As we have
heard, so we have seen." [Psalms\ 48:8]

.SM "THE UNWILLINGNESS OF OUR CHIEF ADVERSARIES,"
.SM "THAT THE SCRIPTURES SHOULD BE DIVULGED"
.SM " IN THE MOTHER TONGUE, ETC\(hy"

Now the Church of Rome would seem at the length to bear a motherly
affection towards her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in
their mother tongue: but indeed it is a gift, not deserving to be
called a gift, an unprofitable gift: [Sophecles] they must first get a
licence in writing before they may use them, and to get that, they must
approve themselves to their Confessor, that is, to be such as are, if
not frozen in the dregs, yet soured with the leaven of their
superstition.  
Howbeit, it seemed too much to Clement the Eighth that
there should be any Licence granted to have them in the vulgar tongue,
and therefore he overruleth and frustrateth the grant of Pius the
Fourth
[see the observation (set forth by Clemen. His authority) upon
the 4. rule of Pius the 4. 
his making in the index, lib. prohib. pag. 15. ver. 5.].
So much are they afraid of the light of the Scripture,
(Lucifugae Scripturarum, as Tertulian speaketh) that they will not
trust the people with it, no not as it is set forth by their own sworn
men, no not with the Licence of their own Bishops and Inquisitors.
Yea, so unwilling they are to communicate the Scriptures to the
people's understanding in any sort, that they are not ashamed to
confess, that we forced them to translate it into English against their
wills.  
This seemeth to argue a bad cause, or a bad conscience, or
both.  
Sure we are, that it is not he that hath good gold, that is
afraid to bring it to the touchstone, but he that hath the counterfeit;
[Tertul. de resur. carnis.] neither is it the true man that shunneth
the light, but the malefactor, lest his deeds should be 
reproved [John\ 3:20]: neither is it 
the plaindealing Merchant that is unwilling to
have the weights, or the meteyard brought in place, but he that useth
deceit.  
But we will let them alone for this fault, and return to
translation.

.SM "THE SPEECHES AND REASONS, BOTH OF OUR BRETHREN,"
.SM "AND OF OUR ADVERSARIES AGAINST THIS WORK"

Many men's mouths have been open a good while (and yet are not stopped)
with speeches about the Translation so long in hand, or rather perusals
of Translations made before: and ask what may be the reason, what the
necessity of the employment: Hath the Church been deceived, say they,
all this while?  
Hath her sweet bread been mingled with leaven, here
silver with dross, her wine with water, her milk with lime? (Lacte
gypsum male miscetur, saith S.\ Ireney [S.\ Iren. 3. lib. cap. 19.]).
We
hoped that we had been in the right way, that we had the Oracles of God
delivered unto us, and that though all the world had cause to be
offended and to complain, yet that we had none.  
Hath the nurse holden
out the breast, and nothing but wind in it?  
Hath the bread been
delivered by the fathers of the Church, and the same proved to be
lapidosus, as Seneca speaketh? 
What is it to handle the word of God
deceitfully, if this be not? 
Thus certain brethren.  
Also the
adversaries of Judah and Jerusalem, like Sanballat in Nehemiah, mock,
as we hear, both the work and the workmen, saying; "What do these weak
Jews, etc\(hy will they make the stones whole again out of the heaps of
dust which are burnt? although they build, yet if a fox go up, he
shall even break down their stony wall." [Nehemiah\ 4:3]\ \0
Was their Translation good before? 
Why do they now mend it?  
Was it not good?
Why then was it obtruded to the people?  
Yea, why did the Catholics
(meaning Popish Romanists) always go in jeopardy, for refusing to go to
hear it?  
Nay, if it must be translated into English, Catholics are
fittest to do it. 
They have learning, and they know when a thing is
well, they can manum de tabula.  
We will answer them both briefly: and
the former, being brethren, thus, with S.\ Jerome, "Damnamus veteres?
Mineme, sed post priorum studia in domo Domini quod possums laboramus."
[S.\ Jerome. Apolog. advers. Ruffin.]\ \0
That is, "Do we condemn the ancient?  
In no case: but after the endeavors of them that were before
us, we take the best pains we can in the house of God." 
As if he said,
Being provoked by the example of the learned men that lived before my
time, I have thought it my duty, to assay whether my talent in the
knowledge of the tongues, may be profitable in any measure to God's
Church, lest I should seem to laboured in them in vain, and lest I
should be thought to glory in men (although ancient), above that which
was in them.  
Thus S.\ Jerome may be thought to speak.

.ne 4
.ce
.SM "A SATISFACTION TO OUR BRETHREN"

And to the same effect say we, that we are so far off from condemning
any of their labors that travailed before us in this kind, either in
this land or beyond sea, either in King Henry's time, or King Edward's
(if there were any translation, or correction of a translation in his
time) or Queen Elizabeth's of ever renowned memory, that we acknowledge
them to have been raised up of God, for the building and furnishing of
his Church, and that they deserve to be had of us and of posterity in
everlasting remembrance.  
The judgment of Aristotle is worthy and well
known: "If Timotheus had not been, we had not had much sweet music;
but if Phrynis [Timotheus his master] had not been, we had not had
Timotheus."  
Therefore blessed be they, and most honoured be their
name, that break the ice, and giveth onset upon that which helpeth
forward to the saving of souls.  
Now what can be more available
thereto, than to deliver God's book unto God's people in a tongue which
they understand? 
Since of a hidden treasure, and of a fountain that is
sealed, there is no profit, as Ptolemy Philadelph wrote to the Rabbins
or masters of the Jews, as witnesseth Epiphanius: [S.\ Epiphan. loco
ante citato.] and as S.\ Augustine saith; "A man had rather be with his
dog than with a stranger (whose tongue is strange 
unto him)." [S.\ Augustin. lib. 19.  de civil. Dei. c. 7.]\ \0
Yet for all that, as nothing
is begun and perfected at the same time, and the later thoughts are
thought to be the wiser: so, if we building upon their foundation that
went before us, and being holpen by their labours, do endeavor to make
that better which they left so good; no man, we are sure, hath cause to
mislike us; they, we persuade ourselves, if they were alive, would
thank us.  
The vintage of Abienzer, that strake the stroke: yet the
gleaning of grapes of Ephraim was not to be despised (see Judges\ 8:2).
Joash the king of Israel did not satisfy himself, till he had smitten
the ground three times; and yet he offended the Prophet, for giving
over then [II Kings\ 13:18-19].
Aquila, of whom we spake before,
translated the Bible as carefully, and as skilfully as he could; and
yet he thought good to go over it again, and then it got the credit
with the Jews, to be called accurately done, as Saint Jerome
witnesseth [S.\ Jerome. in Ezech. cap. 3.].
How many books of profane
learning have been gone over again and again, by the same translators,
by others?  
Of one and the same book of Aristotle's Ethics, there are
extant not so few as six or seven several translations.  
Now if this
cost may be bestowed upon the gourd, which affordeth us a little shade,
and which today flourisheth, but tomorrow is cut down; what may we
bestow, nay what ought we not to bestow upon the Vine, the fruit
whereof maketh glad the conscience of man, and the stem whereof abideth
forever?  
And this is the word of God, which we translate.  
"What is
the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?" [Jeremiah\ 23:28]\ \0
Tanti vitreum,
quanti verum margaritum (saith Tertullian,) [Tertul. ad Martyr.] if a
toy of glass be of that reckoning with us, how ought we to value the
true pearl [Jerome. ad Salvin.]?
Therefore let no man's eye be evil,
because his Majesty is good; neither let any be grieved, that we have
a Prince that seeketh the increase of the spiritual wealth of Israel
(let Sanballats and Tobiahs do so, which therefore do bear their just
reproof) but let us rather bless God from the ground of our heart, for
working this religious care in him, to have the translations of the
Bible maturely considered of and examined.  
For by this means it cometh
to pass, that whatsoever is sound already (and all is sound for
substance, in one or other of our editions, and the worst of ours far
better than their authentic vulgar) the same will shine as gold more
brightly, being rubbed and polished; also, if anything be halting, or
superfluous, or not so agreeable to the original, the same may be
corrected, and the truth set in place.  
And what can the King command
to be done, that will bring him more true honour than this? and wherein
could they that have been set a work, approve their duty to the King,
yea their obedience to God, and love to his Saints more, than by
yielding their service, and all that is within them, for the furnishing
of the work?  
But besides all this, they were the principal motives of
it, and therefore ought least to quarrel it: for the very Historical
truth is, that upon the importunate petitions of the Puritans, at his
Majesty's coming to this Crown, the Conference at Hampton Court having
been appointed for hearing their complaints: when by force of reason
they were put from other grounds, they had recourse at the last, to
this shift, that they could not with good conscience subscribe to the
Communion book, since it maintained the Bible as it was there
translated, which was as they said, a most corrupted translation. 
And
although this was judged to be but a very poor and empty shift; yet
even hereupon did his Majesty begin to bethink himself of the good that
might ensue by a new translation, and presently after gave order for
this Translation which is now presented unto thee. 
Thus much to satisfy
our scrupulous Brethren.

.SM "AN ANSWER TO THE IMPUTATIONS OF OUR ADVERSARIES"

Now to the latter we answer; that we do not deny, nay we affirm and
avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set
forth by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs of the
whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of
God.  
As the King's speech, which he uttereth in Parliament, being
translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Latin, is still the King's
speech, though it be not interpreted by every Translator with the like
grace, nor peradventure so fitly for phrase, nor so expressly for
sense, everywhere.  
For it is confessed, that things are to take their
denomination of the greater part; and a natural man could say, Verum
ubi multa nitent in carmine, non ego paucis offendor 
maculis, etc\(hy [Horace.].
A man may be counted a virtuous man, though he have made
many slips in his life, (else, there were none virtuous, for in many
things we offend all) [James\ 3:2] also a comely man and lovely, though
he have some warts upon his hand, yea, not only freckles upon his face,
but also scars.  
No cause therefore why the word translated should be
denied to be the word, or forbidden to be current, notwithstanding that
some imperfections and blemishes may be noted in the setting forth of
it.  
For whatever was perfect under the Sun, where Apostles or
Apostolic men, that is, men endued with an extraordinary measure of
God's spirit, and privileged with the privilege of infallibility, had
not their hand?  
The Romanists therefore in refusing to hear, and
daring to burn the Word translated, did no less than despite the spirit
of grace, from whom originally it proceeded, and whose sense and
meaning, as well as man's weakness would enable, it did express.  
Judge
by an example or two.  
Plutarch writeth, that after that Rome had been
burnt by the Gauls, they fell soon to build it again: but doing it in
haste, they did not cast the streets, nor proportion the houses in such
comely fashion, as had been most slightly and convenient [Plutarch in
Camillo.]; was Catiline therefore an honest man, or a good patriot, that
sought to bring it to a combustion? or Nero a good Prince, that did
indeed set it on fire?  
So, by the story of Ezra, and the prophecy of
Haggai it may be gathered, that the Temple built by Zerubbabel after
the return from Babylon, was by no means to be compared to the former
built by Solomon (for they that remembered the former, wept when they
considered the latter) [Ezra\ 3:12] notwithstanding, might this latter
either have been abhorred and forsaken by the Jews, or profaned by the
Greeks?  
The like we are to think of Translations. 
The translation of
the Seventy dissenteth from the Original in many places, neither doth
it come near it, for perspicuity, gravity, majesty; yet which of the
Apostles did condemn it?  
Condemn it? 
Nay, they used it, (as it is
apparent, and as Saint Jerome and most learned men do confess) which
they would not have done, nor by their example of using it, so grace
and commend it to the Church, if it had been unworthy of the
appellation and name of the word of God.  
And whereas they urge for
their second defence of their vilifying and abusing of the English
Bibles, or some pieces thereof, which they meet with, for that heretics
(forsooth) were the Authors of the translations, (heretics they call us
by the same right that they call themselves Catholics, both being
wrong) we marvel what divinity taught them so.  
We are sure Tertullian
was of another mind: Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas
[Tertul. de praescript. contra haereses.]?
Do we try men's faith by
their persons? we should try their persons by their faith.  
Also S.\ Augustine was of another mind: for he lighting upon certain rules made
by Tychonius a Donatist, for the better understanding of the word, was
not ashamed to make use of them, yea, to insert them into his own book,
with giving commendation to them so far forth as they were worthy to be
commended, as is to be seen in S.\ Augustine's third book De doctrina
Christiana [S.\ August. 3. de doct. Christ. cap. 30.].
To be short,
Origen, and the whole Church of God for certain hundred years, were of
another mind: for they were so far from treading under foot, (much more
from burning) the Translation of Aquila a Proselyte, that is, one that
had turned Jew; of Symmachus, and Theodotion, both Ebionites, that is,
most vile heretics, that they joined together with the Hebrew Original,
and the Translation of the Seventy (as hath been before signified out
of Epiphanius) and set them forth openly to be considered of and
perused by all.  
But we weary the unlearned, who need not know so much,
and trouble the learned, who know it already.

Yet before we end, we must answer a third cavil and objection of theirs
against us, for altering and amending our Translations so oft; wherein
truly they deal hardly, and strangely with us. 
For to whomever was it
imputed for a fault (by such as were wise) to go over that which he had
done, and to amend it where he saw cause?  
Saint Augustine was not
afraid to exhort S.\ Jerome to a Palinodia or recantation [S.\ Aug.
Epist. 9.]; and doth even glory that he 
seeth his infirmities [S.\ Aug.  Epist. 8.].
If we be sons of the Truth, we must consider what it
speaketh, and trample upon our own credit, yea, and upon other men's
too, if either be any way an hindrance to it.  
This to the cause: then
to the persons we say, that of all men they ought to be most silent in
this case. 
For what varieties have they, and what alterations have they
made, not only of their Service books, Portesses and Breviaries, but
also of their Latin Translation?  
The Service book supposed to be made
by S.\ Ambrose (Officium Ambrosianum) was a great while in special use
and request; but Pope Hadrian calling a Council with the aid of Charles
the Emperor, abolished it, yea, burnt it, and commanded the Service
book of Saint Gregory universally to 
be used [Durand. lib. 5. cap. 2.].
Well, Officium Gregorianum gets by this means to be in credit, but
doth it continue without change or altering?  
No, the very Roman
Service was of two fashions, the New fashion, and the Old, (the one
used in one Church, the other in another) as is to be seen in Pamelius
a Romanist, his Preface, before Micrologus.  
The same Pamelius
reporteth out Radulphus de Rivo, that about the year of our Lord, 1277,
Pope Nicolas the Third removed out of the Churches of Rome, the more
ancient books (of Service) and brought into use the Missals of the
Friers Minorites, and commanded them to be observed there; insomuch
that about an hundred years after, when the above name Radulphus
happened to be at Rome, he found all the books to be new, (of the new
stamp).  
Neither were there this chopping and changing in the more
ancient times only, but also of late: Pius Quintus himself confesseth,
that every Bishopric almost had a peculiar kind of service, most unlike
to that which others had: which moved him to abolish all other
Breviaries, though never so ancient, and privileged and published by
Bishops in their Dioceses, and to establish and ratify that only which
was of his own setting forth, in the year 1568.  
Now when the father of
their Church, who gladly would heal the sore of the daughter of his
people softly and slightly, and make the best of it, findeth so great
fault with them for their odds and jarring; we hope the children have
no great cause to vaunt of their uniformity.  
But the difference that
appeareth between our Translations, and our often correcting of them,
is the thing that we are specially charged with; let us see therefore
whether they themselves be without fault this way, (if it be to be
counted a fault, to correct) and whether they be fit men to throw
stones at us: O tandem maior parcas insane minori: they that are less
sound themselves, out not to object infirmities to others [Horat.].
If
we should tell them that Valla, Stapulensis, Erasmus, and Vives found
fault with their vulgar Translation, and consequently wished the same
to be mended, or a new one to be made, they would answer peradventure,
that we produced their enemies for witnesses against them; albeit, they
were in no other sort enemies, than as S.\ Paul was to the Galatians,
for telling them the truth [Galatians\ 4:16]: and it were to be wished, that
they had dared to tell it them plainlier and oftener.  
But what will
they say to this, that Pope Leo the Tenth allowed Erasmus' Translation
of the New Testament, so much different from the vulgar, by his
Apostolic Letter and Bull; that the same Leo exhorted Pagnine to
translate the whole Bible, and bare whatsoever charges was necessary
for the work [Sixtus Senens.]?
Surely, as the Apostle reasoneth to the
Hebrews, that if the former Law and Testament had been sufficient,
there had been no need of the latter: [Hebrews\ 7:11 and Hebrews\ 8:7] 
so we may say,
that if the old vulgar had been at all points allowable, to small
purpose had labour and charges been undergone, about framing of a new.
If they say, it was one Pope's private opinion, and that he consulted
only himself; then we are able to go further with them, and to aver,
that more of their chief men of all sorts, even their own Trent
champions Paiva and Vega, and their own Inquisitors, Hieronymus ab
Oleastro, and their own Bishop Isidorus Clarius, and their own Cardinal
Thomas a Vio Caietan, do either make new Translations themselves, or
follow new ones of other men's making, or note the vulgar Interpreter
for halting; none of them fear to dissent from him, nor yet to except
against him.  
And call they this an uniform tenor of text and judgment
about the text, so many of their Worthies disclaiming the now received
conceit?  
Nay, we will yet come nearer the quick: doth not their Paris
edition differ from the Lovaine, and Hentenius his from them both, and
yet all of them allowed by authority?  
Nay, doth not Sixtus Quintus
confess, that certain Catholics (he meaneth certain of his own side)
were in such an humor of translating the Scriptures into Latin, that
Satan taking occasion by them, though they thought of no such matter,
did strive what he could, out of so uncertain and manifold a variety of
Translations, so to mingle all things, that nothing might seem to be
left certain and firm in them, etc\(hy? [Sixtus 5. praefat. fixa
Bibliis.].
Nay, further, did not the same Sixtus ordain by an
inviolable decree, and that with the counsel and consent of his
Cardinals, that the Latin edition of the old and new Testament, which
the Council of Trent would have to be authentic, is the same without
controversy which he then set forth, being diligently corrected and
printed in the Printinghouse of Vatican?  
Thus Sixtus in his Preface
before his Bible.  
And yet Clement the Eighth his immediate successor,
published another edition of the Bible, containing in it infinite
differences from that of Sixtus, (and many of them weighty and
material) and yet this must be authentic by all means.  
What is to have
the faith of our glorious Lord 
.SM "JESUS CHRIST"
with Yea or Nay, if this be
not?  
Again, what is sweet harmony and consent, if this be?  
Therefore,
as Demaratus of Corinth advised a great King, before he talked of the
dissensions of the Grecians, to compose his domestic broils (for at
that time his Queen and his son and heir were at deadly feud with him)
so all the while that our adversaries do make so many and so various
editions themselves, and do jar so much about the worth and authority
of them, they can with no show of equity challenge us for changing and
correcting.

.SM "THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSLATORS,"
.SM "WITH THEIR NUMBER, FURNITURE, CARE, ETC\(hy"

But it is high time to leave them, and to show in brief what we
proposed to ourselves, and what course we held in this our perusal and
survey of the Bible.  
Truly (good Christian Reader) we never thought
from the beginning, that we should need to make a new Translation, nor
yet to make of a bad one a good one, (for then the imputation of Sixtus
had been true in some sort, that our people had been fed with gall of
Dragons instead of wine, with whey instead of milk) but to make a good
one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one, not
justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavor, that our
mark.  
To that purpose there were many chosen, that were greater in
other men's eyes than in their own, and that sought the truth rather
than their own praise.  
Again, they came or were thought to come to the
work, not exercendi causa (as one saith) but exercitati, that is,
learned, not to learn: For the chief overseer and [Note: Greek letters
omitted] under his Majesty, to whom not only we, but also our whole
Church was much bound, knew by his wisdom, which thing also Nazianzen
taught so long ago, that it is a preposterous order to teach first and
to learn after, yea that [Note: Greek letters omitted] to learn and
practice together, is neither commendable for the workman, nor safe for
the work [Idem in Apologet.].
Therefore such were thought upon, as
could say modestly with Saint Jerome, Et Hebreaeum Sermonem ex parte
didicimus, et in Latino pene ab ipsis incunabulis etc\(hy detriti sumus.
"Both we have learned the Hebrew tongue in part, and in the Latin we
have been exercised almost from our very cradle."  
S.\ Jerome maketh no
mention of the Greek tongue, wherein yet he did excel, because he
translated not the old Testament out of Greek, but out of Hebrew.  
And
in what sort did these assemble? 
In the trust of their own knowledge,
or of their sharpness of wit, or deepness of judgment, as it were in an
arm of flesh?  
At no hand. 
They trusted in him that hath the key of
David, opening and no man shutting; they prayed to the Lord the Father
of our Lord, to the effect that S.\ Augustine did; "O let thy Scriptures
be my pure delight, let me not be deceived in them, neither let me
deceive by them." [S.\ Aug. lib. II. Confess. cap. 2.]\ \0
In this
confidence, and with this devotion did they assemble together; not too
many, lest one should trouble another; and yet many, lest many things
haply might escape them.  
If you ask what they had before them, truly
it was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the Greek of the New.
These are the two golden pipes, or rather conduits, where-through the
olive branches empty themselves into the gold.  
Saint Augustine calleth
them precedent, or original tongues; [S.\ August. 3. de doctr. c. 3.
etc\(hy] Saint Jerome, fountains [S.\ Jerome. ad Suniam et Fretel.].
The
same Saint Jerome affirmeth, [S.\ Jerome. ad Lucinium, Dist. 9 ut
veterum.] and Gratian hath not spared to put it into his Decree, That
"as the credit of the old Books" (he meaneth of the Old Testament) "is
to be tried by the Hebrew Volumes, so of the New by the Greek tongue,"
he meaneth by the original Greek.  
If truth be tried by these tongues,
then whence should a Translation be made, but out of them?  
These
tongues therefore, the Scriptures we say in those tongues, we set
before us to translate, being the tongues wherein God was pleased to
speak to his Church by the Prophets and Apostles.  
Neither did we run
over the work with that posting haste that the Septuagint did, if that
be true which is reported of them, that they finished it in 72 days;
[Joseph. Antiq. lib. 12.] neither were we barred or hindered from going
over it again, having once done it, like S.\ Jerome, if that be true
which himself reporteth, that he could no sooner write anything, but
presently it was caught from him, and published, and he could not have
leave to mend it: [S.\ Jerome. ad Pammac. pro libr. advers. Iovinian.]
neither, to be short, were we the first that fell in hand with
translating the Scripture into English, and consequently destitute of
former helps, as it is written of Origen, that he was the first in a
manner, that put his hand to write Commentaries upon the Scriptures,
[Sophoc. in Elect.] and therefore no marvel, if he overshot himself
many times. 
None of these things: the work hath not been huddled up in
72 days, but hath cost the workmen, as light as it seemeth, the pains
of twice seven times seventy two days and more: matters of such weight
and consequence are to be speeded with maturity: for in a business of
movement a man feareth not the blame of convenient 
slackness [S.\ Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.].
Neither did we think much to consult
the Translators or Commentators, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek or
Latin, no nor the Spanish, French, Italian, or Dutch; neither did we
disdain to revise that which we had done, and to bring back to the
anvil that which we had hammered: but having and using as great helps
as were needful, and fearing no reproach for slowness, nor coveting
praise for expedition, we have at length, through the good hand of the
Lord upon us, brought the work to that pass that you see.

.SM "REASONS MOVING US TO SET DIVERSITY OF SENSES IN THE MARGIN,"
.SM "WHERE THERE IS GREAT PROBABILITY FOR EACH"

Some peradventure would have no variety of senses to be set in the
margin, lest the authority of the Scriptures for deciding of
controversies by that show of uncertainty, should somewhat be shaken.
But we hold their judgment not to be sound in this point.  
For though,
"whatsoever things are necessary are manifest," as S.\ Chrysostom saith,
[S.\ Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.] and as S.\ Augustine, "In those
things that are plainly set down in the Scriptures, all such matters
are found that concern Faith, Hope, 
and Charity." [S.\ Aug. 2. de doctr.  Christ. cap. 9.]\ \0
Yet for all that it cannot be dissembled,
that partly to exercise and whet our wits, partly to wean the curious
from the loathing of them for their everywhere plainness, partly also
to stir up our devotion to crave the assistance of God's spirit by
prayer, and lastly, that we might be forward to seek aid of our
brethren by conference, and never scorn those that be not in all
respects so complete as they should be, being to seek in many things
ourselves, it hath pleased God in his divine providence, here and there
to scatter words and sentences of that difficulty and doubtfulness, not
in doctrinal points that concern salvation, (for in such it hath been
vouched that the Scriptures are plain) but in matters of less moment,
that fearfulness would better beseem us than confidence, and if we will
resolve upon modesty with S.\ Augustine, (though not in this same case
altogether, yet upon the same ground) Melius est debitare de occultis,
quam litigare de incertis, [S.\ Aug li\(hy S.\ de Genes. ad liter. cap. 5.]
"it is better to make doubt of those things which are secret, than to
strive about those things that are uncertain."  
There be many words in
the Scriptures, which be never found there but once, (having neither
brother or neighbor, as the Hebrews speak) so that we cannot be holpen
by conference of places.  
Again, there be many rare names of certain
birds, beasts and precious stones, etc\(hy concerning the Hebrews
themselves are so divided among themselves for judgment, that they may
seem to have defined this or that, rather because they would say
something, than because they were sure of that which they said, 
as S.\ Jerome somewhere saith of the Septuagint.  
Now in such a case, doth not
a margin do well to admonish the Reader to seek further, and not to
conclude or dogmatize upon this or that peremptorily?  
For as it is a
fault of incredulity, to doubt of those things that are evident: so to
determine of such things as the Spirit of God hath left (even in the
judgment of the judicious) questionable, can be no less than
presumption.  
Therefore as S.\ Augustine saith, that variety of
Translations is profitable for the finding out of the sense of the
Scriptures: [S.\ Aug. 2. De doctr. Christian. cap. 14.] so diversity of
signification and sense in the margin, where the text is no so clear,
must needs do good, yea, is necessary, as we are persuaded.  
We know
that Sixtus Quintus expressly forbiddeth, that any variety of readings
of their vulgar edition, should be put in 
the margin, [Sixtus 5. praef. Bibliae.] (which though it be 
not altogether the same thing to
that we have in hand, yet it looketh that way) but we think he hath not
all of his own side his favorers, for this conceit.  
They that are
wise, had rather have their judgments at liberty in differences of
readings, than to be captivated to one, when it may be the other.  
If
they were sure that their high Priest had all laws shut up in his
breast, as Paul the Second bragged, [Plat. in Paulo secundo.] and that
he were as free from error by special privilege, as the Dictators of
Rome were made by law inviolable, it were another matter; then his word
were an Oracle, his opinion a decision. 
But the eyes of the world are
now open, God be thanked, and have been a great while, they find that
he is subject to the same affections and infirmities that others be,
that his skin is penetrable, and therefore so much as he proveth, not
as much as he claimeth, they grant and embrace.

.SM "REASONS INDUCING US NOT TO STAND CURIOUSLY"
.SM "UPON AN IDENTITY OF PHRASING"

Another things we think good to admonish thee of (gentle Reader) that
we have not tied ourselves to an uniformity of phrasing, or to an
identity of words, as some peradventure would wish that we had done,
because they observe, that some learned men somewhere, have been as
exact as they could that way.  
Truly, that we might not vary from the
sense of that which we had translated before, if the word signified
that same in both places (for there be some words that be not the same
sense everywhere) we were especially careful, and made a conscience,
according to our duty.  
But, that we should express the same notion in
the same particular word; as for example, if we translate the Hebrew or
Greek word once by 
.SM PURPOSE , 
never to call it 
.SM INTENT ; 
if one where
.SM JOURNEYING , 
never 
.SM TRAVELING ; 
if one where 
.SM THINK , 
never 
.SM SUPPOSE ; 
if one where 
.SM PAIN , 
never 
.SM ACHE ; 
if one where 
.SM JOY, 
never 
.SM GLADNESS , 
etc\(hy.
Thus to
mince the matter, we thought to savour more of curiosity than wisdom,
and that rather it would breed scorn in the Atheist, than bring profit
to the godly Reader.  
For is the kingdom of God to become words or
syllables? why should we be in bondage to them if we may be free, use
one precisely when we may use another no less fit, as commodiously?  
A
godly Father in the Primitive time showed himself greatly moved, that
one of newfangledness called [Note: Greek omitted but was a dispute
over the word for "a bed"] [Niceph. Calist. lib.8. cap.42.] though the
difference be little or none; and another reporteth that he was much
abused for turning "Cucurbita" (to which reading the people had been
used) into "Hedera" [S.\ Jerome in 4. Ionae. See S.\ Aug: epist. 10.].
Now if this happens in better times, and upon so small occasions, we
might justly fear hard censure, if generally we should make verbal and
unnecessary changings.  
We might also be charged (by scoffers) with
some unequal dealing towards a great number of good English words. 
For
as it is written of a certain great Philosopher, that he should say,
that those logs were happy that were made images to be worshipped; for
their fellows, as good as they, lay for blocks behind the fire: so if
we should say, as it were, unto certain words, Stand up higher, have a
place in the Bible always, and to others of like quality, Get ye hence,
be banished forever, we might be taxed peradventure with S.\ James his
words, namely, "To be partial in ourselves and judges of evil
thoughts." 
Add hereunto, that niceness in words was always counted the
next step to trifling, and so was to be curious about names too: also
that we cannot follow a better pattern for elocution than God himself;
therefore he using divers words, in his holy writ, and indifferently
for one thing in nature: [see Euseb. li\(hy 12. ex Platon.] we, if we will
not be superstitious, may use the same liberty in our English versions
out of Hebrew and Greek, for that copy or store that he hath given us.
Lastly, we have on the one side avoided the scrupulosity of the
Puritans, who leave the old Ecclesiastical words, and betake them to
other, as when they put 
.SM WASHING 
for 
.SM BAPTISM , 
and 
.SM CONGREGATION 
instead
of 
.SM CHURCH : 
as also on the other side we have shunned the obscurity of
the Papists, in their 
.SM AZIMES , 
.SM TUNIKE , 
.SM RATIONAL , 
.SM HOLOCAUSTS , 
.SM PRAEPUCE ,
.SM PASCHE , 
and a number of such like, whereof their late Translation is
full, and that of purpose to darken the sense, that since they must
needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept
from being understood.  
But we desire that the Scripture may speak like
itself, as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of
the very vulgar.

Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we
had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already.  
It remaineth, that
we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able
to build further than we can ask or think.  
He removeth the scales from
our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may
understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our
affections, that we may love it to the end.  
Ye are brought unto
fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into
them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with
the wicked Jews [Genesis\ 26:15, Jeremiah\ 2:13].  
Others have laboured, and you
may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O
despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot
so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy
things.  
Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our
coast [Matthew\ 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a
mess of pottage [Hebews\ 12:16].  
If light be come into the world, love not
darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not
naked, starve not yourselves.  
Remember the advice of Nazianzene, "It
is a grievous thing" (or dangerous) "to neglect a great fair, and to
seek to make markets afterwards:" also the encouragement 
of S.\ Chrysostom, "It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober" (and
watchful) "should at any time be neglected:" [S.\ Chrysost. in epist. ad
Rom. cap. 14. oral. 26.]\ \0
Lastly, the admonition and 
menacing of S.\ Augustine, "They that despise God's will 
inviting them, shall feel
God's will taking vengeance of them." [S.\ August. ad artic. sibi falso
object. Artic. 16.]\ \0
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God [Hebrews\ 10:31]; but a blessed thing it is, and will bring
us to everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to
hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he
stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are
to do thy will, O God. 
The Lord work a care and conscience in us to
know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all
praise and thanksgiving.

Amen.
