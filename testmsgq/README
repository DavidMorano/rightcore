TESTMSGQ


This program provides an example of using the UNIX Message Queue
IPC facility.

	This program tests the UNIX Message Queue IPC facility that
	exists in newer UNIX-type (or other) OSes that have SYSV type
	features (this was originated on System V).  All versions of
	Solaris have UNIX Message Queues and most other UNIXes that
	have any SYSV features usually also have this.  Note that some
	UNIXes, like Sun Solaris 1 (SunOS 4.x) can disable these
	features by not including them in a newly built kernel !
