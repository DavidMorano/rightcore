book=Genesis 

Chapter 1 

1. In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form,
and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit
of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3. And God said, Let there be
light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that [it was] good:
and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light
Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning
were the first day. 6. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the
midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under
the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and
it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and
the morning were the second day. 9. And God said, Let the waters under
the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land]
appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the
gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it
was] good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth
brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the
tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and
God saw that [it was] good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the
third day. 14. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of
the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights
in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was
so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. 17
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the
earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good. 19 And the
evening and the morning were the fourth day. 20. And God said, Let the
waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and
fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every
winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. 22 And God
blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in
the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and
the morning were the fifth day. 24. And God said, Let the earth bring
forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing,
and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made
the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and
every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw
that [it was] good. 26. And God said, Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27
So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he
him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God
said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
[is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is]
the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And
to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every
thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have
given] every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31. And God saw every
thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening
and the morning were the sixth day. 

Chapter 2

1. Thus the heavens and
the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh
day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh
day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh
day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his
work which God created and made. 4. These [are] the generations of the
heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the
LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 5 And every plant of the field
before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew:
for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there
was] not a man to till the ground. 6 But there went up a mist from the
earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And the LORD God
formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8. And the LORD God
planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had
formed. 9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also
in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it
was parted, and became into four heads. 11 The name of the first [is]
Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where
[there is] gold; 12 And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is]
bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river [is]
Gihon: the same [is] it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 14
And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth
toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates. 15 And
the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress
it and to keep it. 16. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of
every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the
