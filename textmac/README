TEXTMAC (incomplete)

This program changes the old Macintosh line encoding in a file to the
UNIX type.

NOTE: This was a failed attempt to write a version of TEXTCLEAN for
the Mac, but only using STDIO.  It is still possible (maybe) but all
references to many library calls (not readily available on the Mac) must
be either included (code included with the build) or eliminated.
